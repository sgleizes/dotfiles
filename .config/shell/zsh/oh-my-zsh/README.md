# Oh-My-Zsh module

This module provides an integration with
[oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) for demonstration purposes.
It comes with the default OMZ configuration taken from the
[provided template](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/blob/master/templates/zshrc.zsh-template).

To migrate your OMZ configuration to xsh, you can copy this module and
apply your customizations to `@interactive.zsh`.
