# 1. As the only startup file for *all* shells in strict POSIX mode.
# 2. As the only startup file for non-login interactive shells.
# 3. After ~/.profile for login interactive shells.
# For other shells, only the cases 2 and 3 apply.
#

# If `bash` is started with the --posix option (case 1), it will read only this
# file even if the shell is a login shell. It is assumed that users doing that
# want a bare POSIX shell, so we merely return in this case.
# To source a specific startup file, use `ENV=/etc/profile sh --posix`.

# shell (e.g. using `-l`), so a bash-specific check is also included.
