# Dotfiles

These are my personal, opinionated dotfiles.

The main goal is to be able to reproduce the bulk of my terminal and desktop
environments, by versioning the things that I spent time configuring so that
I do not have to spend that time ever again.

I try to keep things configurable, structured and documented, hoping that some
bits might be understandable and usable by other people. But it's also more
maintainable this way.

I try to adhere to the [XDG basedir specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html)
and [file system hierarchy standard](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/file-hierarchy.html#Home%20Directory),
or more exactly I try to hack these reluctant programs that are still doing it
dirty roughly 20 years after the spec was first published, whenever I find it
reasonable to do so. Because a \$HOME should be clean.

I try to use modern yet mature programs which are being maintained, but
sometimes changing long-lived habits is not worth it.

I try to integrate these programs together into a stable and coherent
environment, but there is always a surprise waiting for me somewhere.

I try to have fun doing it, but sometimes it gets rough.

I do not try to support Mac OS. I don't use that.

## What's in there

- Extensive [`zsh` configuration](.config/shell) using
  [xsh](https://github.com/sgleizes/xsh).
- Extensive [`tmux` configuration](.config/tmux).
- Literate [`emacs` configuration](.config/doom) using
  [doom-emacs](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs).
- Configuration for various terminal programs.
- On the `desktop` branch, configuration for my KDE desktop and various desktop
  applications.

## Requirements

- [zsh](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/) - The most powerful shell for interactive and scripting use.
- [git](https://git-scm.com/) - To not be stuck with your own code.

You can also optionally install [svn](https://subversion.apache.org/),
it is used by the zsh configuration to checkout specific parts of GitHub repositories.

## Integrated terminal programs

These programs are all optional and can be selectively picked.
The `zsh` configuration is organized into modules and will integrate the installed programs automatically.

## Zsh plugins

The `zsh` configuration is defined via [xsh](.xsh/zsh/init.zsh) and uses
[zinit](https://github.com/zdharma/zinit) as plugin manager, allowing for
asynchronous loading and lightning fast startup times. Some of the modules are
inspired from [prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto), and some prezto
modules are also directly installed via `zinit`.

Here is a non exhaustive list of integrated external plugins:

- [powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k)
- [zsh-completions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-completions)
- [zsh-fast-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zdharma/fast-syntax-highlighting)
- [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions)
- [zsh-history-substring-search](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-history-substring-search)
